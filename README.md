A simple raymarcher using SFML and GLSL.

Some things are probably set up incorrectly, since my approach to boilerplate stuff is just "throw shit at it until it works, and then never touch it again."

This is just a simple raymarcher that I made for fun. It's not meant to be groundbreaking, and it was my first time using GLSL, so don't expect any incredible feats from it.
